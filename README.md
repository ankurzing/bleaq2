Readme file for Bilevel Evolutionary Algorithm based on Quadratic Approximations - Version 2


Quick instruction for execution:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Code the upper level optimization task in ulExternalProblem.m

Code the lower level optimization task in llExternalProblem.m

xu and xl are the upper and lower level decision vectors respectively

Provide the problem and algorithm parameters in externalProblem.m

Execute it as: externalProblem()

The code is written for maximization at both levels. Feasibility is given as g(x)<=0 and h(x)=0.

The code also allows handling of multiple objectives at upper level. Check the sample implementation of multiobjective SMD1 test problem. The problem can be executed as msmd1() and the implementation of the test problem can be found in ulTestProblem.m (upper level problem) and llTestProblem.m (lower level problem) in the function msmd1().

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BLEAQ2 is the second version of a computationally efficient evolutionary algorithm for non-linear bilevel optimization problems. More information about the working of the algorithm can be found from the following paper.

The current implementation is built on earlier versions and also supports solving bilevel optimization problems with multiple objectives at the upper level. Following papers provide further information about the algorithm.

Executing a user-defined problem
------------------------------------------------------------------------
To execute a user-defined problem, code the upper level optimization task in ulExternalProblem.m and the lower level optimization task in llExternalProblem.m. The functions inside the files contain arguments xu and xl, which represent the upper level decision vector and lower level decision vector respectively.

Provide the problem and algorithm parameters for user-defined problem in externalProblem.m and call the following command to execute the user-defined bilevel optimization task.
externalProblem()

The results of the execution are printed on the screen as well as stored in 'externalProblem.mat'. A sample bilevel optimization problem is already coded as an external problem.

Problem parameters to be defined in externalProblem.m

ulDim: Number of dimensions at upper level.

llDim: Number of dimensions at lower level.

ulDimMax: Vector defining maximum values for upper level variables.

ulDimMin: Vector defining minimum values for upper level variables.

llDimMax: Vector defining maximum values for lower level variables.

llDimMin: Vector defining minimum values for lower level variables.

Algorithm parameters to be defined in externalProblem.m

ulPopSize: Upper level population size.

llPopSize: Lower level population size.

ulMaxGens: Upper level maximum generations.

llMaxGens: Lower level maximum generations.

ulStoppingCriteria: Stopping parameter at upper level. Smaller the value higher the accuracy.

llStoppingCriteria: Stopping parameter at lower level. Smaller the value higher the accuracy.

There are other parameters in the algorithm. However, most of them are either adaptive or not necessary to be adjusted.

Output of the execution

ulEliteFunctionValue: Upper level function value for the elite member.

llEliteFunctionValue: Lower level function value for the elite member.

ulEliteIndiv: Upper level elite member.

llEliteIndiv: Lower level elite member.

ulFunctionEvaluations: Upper level function evaluations required during the exection.

llFunctionEvaluations: Lower level function evaluations required during the exection.


Executing the SMD or TP suite
------------------------------------------------------------------------
To execute one of the SMD test problems (say SMD1), the following command needs to be called:

smd1()

This executes the SMD1 test problem with problem and algorithm parameters coded in smd1.m. It executes a 5 variable SMD1 problem with 2 upper level variables and 3 lower level variables. The results are printed on the screen as well as stored in 'smd1.mat'

To execute one of the problems in TP-Suite (say TP1), the following command needs to be called:

tp1()

This executes tp1 with problem and algorithm parameters coded in tp1.m. The results are printed on the screen as well as stored in 'tp1.mat'
